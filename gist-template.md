## Introduction

A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is a reference to a web resource that specifies its location on the internet. Validating URLs is crucial in web applications to ensure proper functionality and security. Let's dive into the components of the regular expression used for matching URLs.

## Regex Components

The regular expression for matching URLs comprises several components, each responsible for validating a specific part of the URL.

### Protocol

The protocol component specifies the communication protocol (e.g., http, https) at the beginning of the URL. It is optional but must end with `://`.

```regex
^(https?|ftp)://
```
